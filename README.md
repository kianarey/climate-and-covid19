# Correlation Between Climate Variables and the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Twin Cities, MN
#### Tiny Earth Summer Research 2020

## Project Description
Changing climate conditions has a major impact on public health, especially the transmission of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. COVID-19 is a novel virus that spreads through respiratory droplets produced through coughs, sneezes, or talks by an infected person (cdc.org). Inspired by the research project done in New York City by M.F Bashir et al. (2020) where minimum temperature and average temperature are correlated with the spread of COVID-19, this study examines climate variables and COVID-19 cases in the Twin Cities, which comprise of these seven counties: Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, and Washington. The first confirmed COVID-19 case took place in Ramsey County on March 6, 2020, and as of June 23, 2020, there are 21,056 confirmed cases in the Twin Cities.
