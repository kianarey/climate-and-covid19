# Correlation Between Climate Variables and the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Twin Cities, MN
#### Tiny Earth Summer Research 2020

## Project Description
Changing climate conditions has a major impact on public health, especially the transmission of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. COVID-19 is a novel virus that spreads through respiratory droplets produced through coughs, sneezes, or talks by an infected person (cdc.org). Inspired by the research project done in New York City by M.F Bashir et al. (2020) where minimum temperature and average temperature are correlated with the spread of COVID-19, this study examines climate variables and COVID-19 cases in the Twin Cities, which comprise of these seven counties: Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, and Washington. The first confirmed COVID-19 case took place in Ramsey County on March 6, 2020, and as of June 23, 2020, there are 21,056 confirmed cases in the Twin Cities.

## Results
Results from both Spearman and Kendall correlation tests indicate there are positive correlations between the COVID-19 and climate datasets. Average temperature is significant for total cases and mortality, and minimum temperature is significant for new cases. 

Despite strong evidence of association between climate variables and COVID-19 in the Twin Cities, this study has limitations. First, COVID-19 is an infectious disease that was not tested prior to this time frame and is influenced by many factors not mentioned in this study, such as social distancing, accessibility to healthcare, and personal hygiene and health conditions. Second, it is important to note that temperatures naturally increase during the studied time frame. Therefore, more studies are needed to further assess and compare correlation results when temperatures naturally decrease after June 23rd, 2020. Lastly, this study only examines maximum, minimum, and average temperatures. Other climate indicators such as humidity, wind speed, air quality, and precipitation need to be assessed in order to fully capture the correlation between climate variables and COVID-19 pandemic.
